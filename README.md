#Horiseon Optimization

## Accessibility and SEO

It is very crucial to make the website accessible and optimized for search engines. 
The changes in the code focuses on improving the structure of html and CSS files. Now it has alternative text being displayed if images fails to load on browser for some reason. Redundant sections in CSS files are removed and comments are added as required, so it is more concise and readable.  
Interesting part I observed while working on this project was how working on one element in CSS and can give you ideas about different elements in the same file. It is all well inter-linked!
